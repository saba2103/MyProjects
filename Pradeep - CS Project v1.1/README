This a small password game in which you have to guess the right random 4 digit 
number generated. My bestie Pradeep came up with this. He got the from Sleeping Dogs game.
I did this for him for his 12th grade project.

run the crack.cpp file.
make sure you have all the other files also in the same dir.
