I created this game during my 12th grade. I was not taught about file handling when i started this.
I was so excited with this. So, i learnt it myself and it worked out. That's why the code looks messy.

There was no graphics.h and time.h in the syllabus and hence, my creativity was limited. And i decided to
get to work with just the available resources and not learn anything new coz i had no time for all that.

So, let me tell you what i did for time delay. I had a partner named Sumukha. He gave came up with this idea. 
He actually noticed that a for loop of 10000 and more iterations
took a few seconds to complete. so he made a senseless for loop of more than 10000 iterations.
On calling this function 'n' number of times helped us to achieve different time intervals.
As you already figured out, this purely depeneded on the computer's speed. We created according to our school computer speed.
And the code runs damn slow in my PC. :P 

So, i got some free time after 12th and i decided to organize the code properly. i didn't try to correct the mess
coz the code was so inefficient and had no time for it. So, finally i learnt time.h and used it.
So, now the game is perfectly cool. 

P.S. So, if you just wanna have fun, play only the game and don't go through the code. It drives you mad. :P

This whole idea was my own and never copied from anywhere. And i wrote the whole program all by myself.
